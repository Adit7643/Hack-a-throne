We wanted to build a platform to showcase the cultural diversity of India as well as to connect people and let them explore the different cultures and festivals in India. Our vision to make a platform where a person can get information about culture and festivals of each state and allows him to attend the events of function happening nearby him.
FUNCTIONALITIES:

1.Information about culture and heritage of each and every state.User has to enter a state while logging and it will directly take them to a page which will showcase the rich heritage about the state.

2.Allowing them to attend events and festivals happening around them.User has to enter his/her location and it will instantly show all the nearby festivals and events either small scale or large scale happening around him. He/She can buy tickets(paid/free) from the online portal itself and will also get the exact location of the place.

3.Diving Deep into the heritage of an unknown state. Users can enjoy the rich heritage of the state in just one platform either through a website or an app.

4.Giving users the opportunity to list their events in the portal allowing them to host a event (small/large scale). This can give them the opportunity to connect with different people or even make revenue thorugh showcasing their culture.

5.People can also interact in this platform by sharing their experiences in the states and user can also share his/her experiences, fostering a sense of community and ownership.

6.This platoform will act as  a valuable resource for tourists seeking authentic cultural experiences, promoting local attractions and economic development. Example: The portal can highlight popular tourist destinations, suggest off-the-beaten-path experiences, and provide information on local cuisine and accommodations.

7.By using the user's data it will enhance user engagement. Example: Based on a user's past event history and interests, the portal could recommend traditional dance performances, art exhibitions, or food festivals.

8.Offer immersive virtual tours of historical sites, museums, and cultural landmarks, allowing users to explore from anywhere. Example: Users can take virtual tours of the Taj Mahal, explore ancient temples, or visit museums without leaving their homes.

9.Fill a void in the Indian market by offering a dedicated platform for discovering and experiencing state-specific cultural events. Example: There is a lack of comprehensive platforms that focus specifically on the cultural events and attractions of individual Indian states.



Through this portal we can explore lot of things and these this things do not exists at a single platform in the market. Through our Prototype(in Figma) we have shown what all things can be achieved in this field and what is our vision and you will get to know out thoughtprocess. Apart from all these things many other functionalities  can be integrated in the website or application.

we have created prototype and  we were able to make 60 percent of the website, we plan to make it fully. we have attached figma link, the link on which our website is deployed.And also the repository of the App development files below. You can go thrrough that
